# This is the source of the MIPS version of chastelib
# The four basic functions have been translated from Intel x86 Assembly
# They are as follows
#
# putstring (prints string pointed to by $s0 register)
# intstr (converts integer in $s0 register to a string)
# putint (prints integer in $s0 register by use of the previous two functions)
# strint (converts a string pointed to by $s0 register into an integer in $s0)
#
# Most importantly, the intstr and strint functions depend on a global variable (radix)
# In fact, these two functions are the foundation of everything.
# They can convert to and from any radix from 2 to 36
